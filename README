### emulator

How to build an emulator
- Generate training data in ../clust/results_{stat}/training_{stat}{traintag}
- Generate testing data in ../clust/results_{stat}/testing_{stat}
- Calculate error with e.g. calc_aemulus_error.py, save to file
- Run train_gp.py with proper parameters (takes ~hours, submit to queue with job_traingp.pbs)
- While training, compute means per box of testing data, with calc_means.py
- Run test_gp.py with proper parameters
- Plot in notebook, see wp.ipynb as example; plotting scripts in plotter.py
